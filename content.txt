| \gBuilds (Incremental Slides)

Builds are separated by two dashes (\r--\s) on a line by themselves.

Type '\bn\s' a few times to see how it works.

\*Phase 1\s: Collect underpants

\*Phase 2\s: ?

\*Phase 3\s: Profit

| \gText Alignment

Text can be aligned with ease. Just start a line with one of the
following commands. The space after the command is mandatory.

<< '\r<< \s' flushes the line to the left of the screen.

< '\r< \s' aligns the line to the left of the slide (default).

| '\r| \s' centers the line.

> '\r> \s' aligns the line to the right of the slide.

>> '\r>> \s' flushes the line to the right of the screen.

Whitespace other than the one following the alignment command
is preserved. You can easily align manually if needed.
